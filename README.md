FakeStore Project

Overview

This project is a simple e-commerce application built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to browse products, add them to cart, and view their cart.

Installation and Running the Project

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using git clone.
Navigate to the project directory using cd FakeStore.
Install the dependencies using npm install.
Start the development server using npm start.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
Design Decisions and Notable Features

The project uses a modular design, with separate components for the header, product cards, and cart dropdown.
The application uses a state management system to keep track of the products, cart items, and selected category.
The project uses TypeScript to ensure type safety and catch errors at compile-time.
The application uses Vite as the development server and build tool.
The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
The application fetches data from the Fake Store API to populate the product list.
Areas for Improvement

One area where I struggled was with the implementation of the cart functionality. I would improve this by adding more features, such as the ability to remove items from the cart and update the quantity of items.
Another area for improvement is the error handling. Currently, the application does not handle errors well, and would benefit from more robust error handling and logging.
I would also improve the performance of the application by optimizing the API calls and reducing the number of re-renders.
Additionally, I would add more features to the application, such as user authentication and payment processing.
Future Development

Add user authentication and authorization to restrict access to certain features.
Implement payment processing to allow users to purchase products.
Add more features to the cart, such as the ability to remove items and update quantities.
Improve the performance of the application by optimizing API calls and reducing re-renders.
Add more products and categories to the application.
Improve the user interface and user experience of the application.
